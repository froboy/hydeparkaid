title: Hyde Park COVID-19 Resource Outreach

<mark>Hyde Park Help has concluded its efforts. In roughly two years of operation it redistributed over $50,000 to cover over 600 financial requests. We greatly appreciate all of those who contributed and supported our efforts.</mark>

## What is this?

This project started as a temporary mutual aid effort to support each other in the Hyde Park, Chicago Community when COVID-19 began. The need for groups like this have only become more clear in recent weeks. In Hyde Park and our surrounding neighborhoods, there are a large number of families that were living paycheck to paycheck. The current pandemic has meant that many of these individuals have not been working or making their full incomes for several months now with no end in sight. This is an effort to connect those of us that have been privileged with economic security to redistribute our funds to those that have not.
